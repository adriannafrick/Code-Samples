# Code-Samples
### Basic coding projects

Although I haven't worked in a formal coding capacity, from time to time I've had to learn various languages to accomplish a particular task for a client.
These projects are often temporary in nature, and I may find myself needing a completely different skill set for the next client. The snippets offered here are to show an ability to read basic code in a variety of languages, rather than showcase an experienced front-end, back-end, or data science skill set.
Languages include various incarnations of Javascript, including Node.js, ES6, and React, as well as BASH scripting, and a little R. I may also include YAML files for various CI/CD functionality or Kubernetes configurations.
